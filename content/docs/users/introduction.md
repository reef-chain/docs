## Get started

If you're looking for things you can do with Reef, check out the [Reef Ecosystem](/docs/users/ecosystem) and [AwesomeReef](https://awesomereef.xyz).

### Build on Reef

Get started with Reef by installing the [Reef node](/docs/developers/nodes/), and deploying a simple DeFi app locally in [Quick Start]({{< ref "quick-start" >}}).

For in depth tutorials on the underlying aspects of the Reef chain check out the [Developer Guide]({{< ref "quick-start" >}}) and the [Developer Resources]({{< ref "resources" >}}).

### Governance

[Validators](/docs/governance/validators/) and [Nominators](/docs/governance/nominators/) are essential to the Reef ecosystem.

Learn how to [stake](/docs/governance/staking/) your Reef tokens and vote for validators. Highly technical users may also participate in validator elections to have a chance of becoming a paid block producer.


## Why Reef?
Reef is fast, scalable, has low transaction costs and features easy-to-use core apps.

Reef chain features next-gen blockchain technology, utilizing Nominated Proof of Stake, extensible EVM, on-chain upgradability, libp2p networking and state of the art cryptography.

### Fees
Reef is efficient, and has a predictable algorithmic fee model. All fees from Reef chain usage are
automatically burned.
