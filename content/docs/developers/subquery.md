SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer empowering developers with fast, flexible, and universal decentralised APIs for their web3 projects. With the SubQuery SDK, developers can access rich indexed data and create immersive decentralised applications with efficiency and speed. SubQuery supports numerous ecosystems including Reef, Polkadot, Cosmos, Ethereum, Polygon, Algorand, NEAR, and Avalanche.

One of SubQuery's key strengths lies in its ability to aggregate data not only within a single blockchain but also across multiple blockchains within a unified project. This enables the development of advanced analytics dashboards, cross-chain block scanners, and initiatives focused on indexing XCM messages across parachains.

Superior performance is guaranteed with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities, and a customisable caching architecture. To learn more, explore the comprehensive [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/).

## Running and Hosting Reef SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is committed to open-source principles, offering the flexibility to run it in three ways:

- Locally (or a cloud provider). Refer to the [instructions](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html) on how to set this up.
- Utilise enterprise-level [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network/), where the project is hosted with production-ready services, ensuring zero-downtime blue/green deployments and a generous free tier. Discover [how to get started](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html).
- Publish it to the [decentralised network](https://subquery.network/network), the ultimate data service for dApp developers, combining openness, performance, reliability, and scalability. SubQuery Network indexes and delivers data to the global community in a verifiable and incentivised manner and has supported Reef from launch.
